ThePointsGuy. SaveonFlights. So many different websites, hard-to-navigate with unorganized blog posts and what not. Sure
they help in trip planning, but now more than ever before, people rely on their apps as a quick and easy download and access
point for their everyday needs (Notes, Reminders, Maps, etc.) Now introducting the Hyatt Las Vegas Application to help anyone
save money and enjoy a trip of a lifetime. This app was inspired by my dad, who continuously provides for my family and allows
us to have an enjoyable vacation with the ideas, tricks, and methods presented in this app! He let me in on his secrets to planning
a Las Vegas vacation with Hyatts and what you must know before going to make the most out of your money. Another very important
part of this app to me is to make it fun, I added cartoon characters of past cartoons I used to watch that made a huge impact on me
when I was a little girl. This symbolizes women empowerment to me, something I am passionate about, which explains why I added
a different female character to each screen to help out the app users figure out their dream trip. 12/1/2019: Initial commit, began to plan app.
